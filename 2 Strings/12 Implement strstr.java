/**

Your task is to implement the function strstr. The function takes two strings as arguments (s,x) and  locates the occurrence of the string x in the string s. The function returns and integer denoting the first occurrence of the string x in s (0 based indexing).

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two strings s and x.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, output will be an integer denoting the first occurrence of the x in the string s. Return -1 if no match found.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't have to take any input. Just complete the strstr() function which takes two strings str, target as an input parameter. The function returns -1 if no match if found else it returns an integer denoting the first occurrence of the x in the string s.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|*|x|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Note : Try to solve the question in constant space complexity.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 200
1 <= |s|,|x| <= 1000

Example:
Input
2
GeeksForGeeks Fr
GeeksForGeeks For
Output
-1
5

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Fr is not present in the string GeeksForGeeks as substring.
Testcase 2: For is present as substring in GeeksForGeeks from index 5 (0 based indexing).
